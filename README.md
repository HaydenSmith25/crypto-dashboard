# Crypto-Dashboard

ABOUT: Crypto Dashboard that is bootstrapped with REACT.js. This projects leverages two API's to fetch crypto prices for conversion on the sight and a crypto news feed that allows users to clink on popular articles in the space. This tutorial allowed me to work on weak points that I'm trying to iron out within REACT and gave me the opportunity to get creative with website styling. Still struggle with overal css design - mainly due to my limited creative capacity when it comes to making sites that are easy on the eyes and coordinate properly with the overal sheme I'm trying to display. Biggest takeways from this tutorial project was 1.(how far I've come with my abilities within REACT), 2.(Clearler understanding of REACT and making proper API calls).
