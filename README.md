# Crypto-Dashboard

ABOUT: Crypto Dashboard that is bootstrapped with Create React App. This project leverages two APIs to fetch crypto prices for conversion on the site and a crypto news feed that allows users to click on popular articles in the space. This personal project allowed me to work on weak points that I'm trying to iron out within REACT and gave me the opportunity to get creative with website styling. Still struggle with overall CSS design - mainly due to my limited creative capacity when it comes to making sites that are easy on the eyes and coordinate properly with the overall scheme I'm trying to display. Biggest takeways from this tutorial project was 1.(how far I've come with my abilities within REACT), 2.(Clearler understanding of REACT and making proper API calls). Side-note, API keys are not properly store in this project but for the sake of it being a practice project they are stored in a .env file that is added to node_modules.
